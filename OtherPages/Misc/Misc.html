                Here is a collection of some videos showing off some random different things that I have made but were not a part of any larger project.
                Mostly you will find demos of shaders and such that I made but 
                do not plan to write a lengthy blog post about. You will find a short discription of the technique used for every video.

                            <p>
                                A water shader made in Unity. Main features are the planar reflections used to reflect the scene geometry and skybox. It is does this by rendering
                                a second camera reflected over the water plane and settings its projection matrix so that this second cameras near plane is equal to the water plane.
                                Then by passing this rendered image to the water shader, we can manipulate the uvs of the water shader by the normal at the fragment position to create
                                the effect of refraction. Additionally, the shore foam uses noise textures to create more organic looking foam than by just looking in the depth buffer.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The big feature of this water shader is the procedural water caustics that are prjected on to the scene geometry. They are most easily seen on
                                the rocks on the left side of the video. This effect was created by reconstructing the world space position of the scene geometry behind the water
                                plane by using the depth buffer. Then we can sample a caustics texture with these world space positions being used as UV coordinates. Furthermore,
                                we can split the colors of the caustics texture by doing three texture samples with different offsets for each color channel and then add them
                                back together to get the prism effect of water caustics.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The big feature of this water shader is SDF foam lines around all of the geometry. This effect is achieved by using an orthographic camera
                                looking down on the scene. The near plane of this camera is set equal to the water plane in the scene. We then render all objects seen by the
                                camera with a simple shader that first renders their backfaces and then then their front faces. When rendering the back faces we write one into a
                                render texture. When rendering the front faces we write a zero. The result of this is a render texture that has the shapes of all the objects in the
                                scene at the height of the water plane. I then use the Jump Flood algorithm to expand the area of shapes. We then can sample this render texture
                                in the water shader to get the SDF shapes. I also use another render texture to store the previous SDF shape, so that we can get nice water trails for
                                moving objects.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                This was an experiment with compute shaders in Unity. It works by using compute shaders to create many layers of stacked meshes on the GPU and
                                then drawing them procedurally from that generated data. This create the illusion of volumetric clouds. The system also is also endless so as the
                                camera moves the chucks of clouds will get discarded and generated to keep them centered over the player. The shader used for drawing uses noise
                                maps to create the final cloud shape. I ramped up the offsets over time in the sampling of these noise maps in the above video to really show
                                how the cloud shapes are not static and can change over time.

                            <p>
                                This is a post processing effect to give volumetric lighting to windows that may be in a scene. It works by using the direction of the main
                                light in the scene to create a bounding box from the window object to the ground. This bounding box can then be used in ray interection calculations
                                to ray march only through where the light should be projected into the scene. Then as we ray march through the bounding volume we project a vector
                                from the point in the volume to the plane of the window and sample the texture of the window. The result of the ray marching is combined into one
                                value and is used to color that screen pixel. We also sample shadow maps at each point in the ray marching to not add colors for positions that cannot
                                see the light.

                                This is some video from a custom terrain editor I started building in Unity. I use command buffers to draw into splat maps that can then be
                                sampled in the shader for the terrain to allow for lots of different textures and blending of textures. I also use compute shaders to calculate
                                localToWorld matrices for positions on the terrain where you can draw meshes to. These meshes then get drawn procedurally to allow for thousands of
                                detail meshes on the terrain. The second part of the video is showing off some LODing used so that we do not waste time drawing details that will
                                not be scene by the player.

                                This video is just showing a couple of FX I made for a mock-up character controller I was working on. The first effect is a sonic boom. It works
                                by spawning a particles and the player position as the player moves through their dash ability. The particles use billboarding to face the camera.
                                The shader for the particles use a ring texture and a grab pass to sample the scene behind the particle. The ring texture determines offsets to use
                                when sampling the grab pass. The particle grows over time to create the effect of the sonic boom. The video also shows a simple weapon summoning 
                                effect. The shader for the weapon samples a noise texture to dissolve into the scene when the player wants to pull out their weapon.
